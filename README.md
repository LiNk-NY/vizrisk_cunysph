## MetSafe: Metabolic Syndrome and Food Environment

We developed an interactive visualization using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey data as part of the US Department of Health and Human Services' VizRisk competition. 
The aim of this project is to present the point prevalence of a group of self-reported risk factors that constitute metabolic syndrome across the United States and to display possible influential factors.  

This shiny visualization web application was proudly developed by Levi Waldron PhD., Marcel Ramos, Finn Schubert, Cody Boppert, Jasmine Abdelnabi, Henry Wang, Kezhen Fei, Ragheed Al-dulaimi, and Dr. Ashish Joshi.
